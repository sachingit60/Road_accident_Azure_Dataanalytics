-Azure Data Factory: To orchestrate the data movement and transformation steps.
-Azure Databricks: To perform data transformation and machine learning tasks.
-Azure Synapse Analytics: To store and analyze the data.

#Architecture

-Azure Data Factory copies data from various sources (e.g., relational databases, NoSQL databases, and cloud storage) to Azure Synapse Analytics.
-Azure Databricks transforms the data and performs machine learning tasks.
-Azure Synapse Analytics stores and analyzes the transformed data.
